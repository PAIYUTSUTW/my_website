## Project Description
A novel approach to defend against APT attacks, specifically targeting lateral movement.

### Key Achievements:
* Designed and executed simulations that accurately represented attacker lateral movements
* Created specialized datasets for training reinforcement learning models
* Formulated APT attack into Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problems

### Technologies Used:
* Reinforcement Learning
* TensorFlow/PyTorch
* Network Security Simulation
