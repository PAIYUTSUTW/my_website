Lateral movement attacks pose significant threats to cybersecurity by stealthily navigating through networks to compromise critical machines. Reactive defenses often struggle against these sophisticated attacks, as they respond only after detection.

To address this limitation, we propose a proactive defense strategy that takes preventive actions based on the observed states of a network. Specifically, we model the lateral movement defense problem as a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and develop an effective Q-learning approach to train the defense strategy. The primary objective of this strategy is to maximize the time an attacker takes to compromise a target machine.ted to partial
observability and high-dimensional states.
