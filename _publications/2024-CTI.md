SIEM systems are prevalent and play a critical role in a variety of analyst workflows in Security Operation Centers. However, modern SIEMs face a big challenge: they still cannot relieve analysts from the repetitive tasks involved in analyzing CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) reports written in natural languages. This project aims to develop an AI agent to replace the labor intensive repetitive tasks involved in analyzing CTI reports. The agent exploits the revolutionary capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), but it does not require any human intervention.
