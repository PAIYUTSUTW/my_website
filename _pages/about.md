Currently, as a Ph.D. student in Informatics at Penn State, I am conducting research under the guidance of Professor Peng Liu, who directs both the Penn State Cyber Security Lab and the Lion Center. Prior to this, I was involved in three significant projects at Academia Sinica in Taiwan, focusing on threat intelligence and threat hunting. My current research interest lies in leveraging Large Language Models to enhance the capabilities of Security Operations Centers in threat intelligence and threat hunting. I am committed to advancing this field by developing innovative technology solutions that improve organizational responses to cyber threats and safeguard information security.
